# Go Demo Application - Car Service Booking webapp

This is a Go demo application for a talk I did on [Go](golang.org) at the [Google Developer Group Johannesburg meetup](https://www.meetup.com/GDGJohannesburg/events/241109336/) in August 2017.

Slide for the talk is [here](https://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/pieterlouw/talks/go-intro-gdgjhb-aug2017/go-intro.slide)

This application uses standard Go, [sqlite](https://sqlite.org/) and [go-sqlite3 driver](github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3) (for database operations) and [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/) for the CSS framework.

The demo is based on insights from the following articles/blogs:
